How to use Python Proxy

1) open a terminal and run the following
	python PythonProxy.py
2) After the proxy is running and verifies that it is running on port 8080 then start up Wireshark by running the following command in the terminal
	sudo wireshark
3) Within Wireshark make sure that you capture packets from 'any' interface and filter for http traffic
4) To make an http request through the terminal use the following command:
   curl -O -x localhost:8080 http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html --output file.html
	or
   curl -x localhost:8080 http://www.freeimageslive.com/galleries/sports/relaxation/pics/beach_walk.jpg > image.jpg
